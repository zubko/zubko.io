JavaScript is quite a flexible language. It's good to see different ways of using it and how it can be used to implement some well known patterns. Also the book has some information on technologies and patterns that I missed either because they aren't common in React development or they became rarely used in general as of 2019. It's fascinating how quickly the things can move for the Web development. For example we don't see much prototypal inheritance while making React apps (while it's still present behind the scenes, when we use ES6 classes) and AMD modules are the thing from the past, but sometimes this acronym is still seen here and there, so it's good to know what does it refer to. And it's also good to brush up some design patterns in general. Quite a quick read, because some information about libraries / patterns of the past can be skimmed through.
