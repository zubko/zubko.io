This is an epic course about Android development! Just only check the number of instructors involved. The video content is of high quality (and even has some entertainment value). The structure is very well thought out to touch the most important parts of Android dev. The only negative side is that because of the mainstream approach to working with data changed so some new content of less quality was added and the lessons about SQLite are skipped but there are still some exercises to do. So some quick structural changes were happening without hiding the old part by 100%. That's a little unfortunate, but considering how quickly things can change in modern development it's understandable that the course makers or maintainers have to change the content. Other than that it's an epic course to touch some Android code, exercises and TODOs in the code are awesome, even if knowing some Android dev already, it's great to check yourself for any basics missing.
