This was quite a fast read in the august of 2020 when I was working on implementing WCAG requirements for the Web app. It is full of little nuances in the implementation of UI components with accessibility in mind. Lots of recommendations based on the extensive experience of the author in this area. And I think this book helps to set the thinking in the right direction with the focus to details. I'd definitely recommend this book to developers who are working in this area and it's a good read for any developer who is going to implement UIs or who is curious what kind of problems are solved by engineers who work on accessibility.
