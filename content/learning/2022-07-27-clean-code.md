This is of course a book that can be called a "classic" and a "must read" book for any person who writes code that will be read by others including the author of the code themselves. As it's important to remember that we write code not so only for computers to execute but also much more for others to read and change in the future.

This book explores what "clean code" is and how to get from "dirty code" to "clean code" because it's kinda easy to notice flaws or to say "this is a badly written code", but it's much harder to produce a clear objective statement why a certain code is "bad" or why some code is better than another and what are steps to get from "bad" to "good" (or in this case from "dirty" to "clean").

I like especially the section with heuristics about different "code smells" and the reasoning behind them. Also, the examples and case studies are great material, although the case studies are also a bit more demanding to follow (this was one of the reasons I finished the book only recently, although I read the "theoretical" part much earlier in my career). The case studies put the theory to practice and emphasize the importance of having an elaborate test suite before working on improving the code. (Of course, everybody had a situation when they improved something about the code and then some things became broken functionally which were working before and that can become discouraging to continue to improve the code, so a good test suite is a must to be able to proceed with refactoring without surprises.)

It's said there that it's important to "care" about the code quality and about becoming a better programmer. But I think this book is a must for everybody - to those who care and to those who don't, maybe they will start caring a bit more and all their colleagues will be very thankful to Robert Martin during code review for influencing them. :)
