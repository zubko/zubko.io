I got a number of different books from Humble Bundle, and for some reason I could not resist starting reading this one, even though I have other active books and courses. I think the accessibility of the information in the book played a big role in that. Actually, I did not expect that this book is intended for beginners or non-programmers, and it was a bit of disappointment at first, but then I liked how easy it's to read this book, comparing to "serious" literature about algorithms (and considering also that I knew already a big chunk of information in this book). But at the same time it was good to remember some parts that I forgot, because in general day to day programming it's not very often happens to write a quicksort implementation, although it's actually an interesting thing to write, and I've seen some new perspectives on things that I knew, and eventually learned some new things, when we came to more advanced topics, like dynamic programming.

I think in general it's an entertaining quick read. Key take aways for me:

- brush up some basic algorithm skills
- brush up some basic Python
- learn about dynamic programming
- learn about KNN algorithms
- great small teasers about advanced algorithms to fuel the interest
- learning about algrorithms is awesome
- Python is great in general
- I know a book now which I can recommend to a person who has only started to do some programming
