I was looking for a quick read to refresh myself on iOS Swift development, but this book is a bit different than that. It takes more or less the most high level point on all processes connected with Swift development in general and author shares his ideas about them.

In general I agree with the description of the book from its author "the guide I wish I had when I started out many moons ago". This book can be helpful in the beginning of the development career in general.

The best takeaway for me from this book is to remember to be goal oriented on a low and high level. With a multitude of super interesting things to do and learn in the world and in programming particularly, it's becoming even more important to always have an answer for "why are you doing this?" or "why are you learning this?", plus set the measurable goal, set some time frame, do the measurement of the progress etc.
