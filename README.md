# Short

The source code of my personal [website/blog/portfolio/playground](https://zubko.io/) built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

---

# Intro

This is my take of how I see my ideal personal website and yet a wish to share some knowledge that I get while programming, which I hope will be indexed by search engines and from which other developers can benefit.

Right now the website is on a very early stage. I have a lot of notes how it should and can be. And there is a lot for what I don't have a vision yet, and the new ideas will come on the way.

# What I know

## Ideology

* Personal playground.
* Adoping `release early and often` mantra.
* Using only the best tools.
* Trying to keep ~~perfectionism~~ at a short leash.
* Yet attention to details is important.
* Minimalism in design.

## Technology and tools stack which I love

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) + React - yes! i always wanted to be able to [embed a date picker to a blog post](https://gatsbyjs.github.io/gatsby-starter-blog/2016-12-9-react-component-post/) 😀
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - I can't praise it enough: CI, static website hosting, HTTPS at the same time. I ❤️ to be able to push code change to git and to see it live in production in a minute. (It's a special pleasure for an iOS developer, where we need to wait for App Store review (esp before React Native, CodePush and Expo entered the stage)).
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - A modern, extensible and yet pretty lightweight editor which is a pleasure to use on a daily basis for anything Web and RN related.
* [Tower App 🗼](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/) - the best Git app out there (after the original command line tool of course 🙇🏼)
* [Sketch App](https://www.sketchapp.com) - sometimes it's much faster to explore ideas in drawing than in code 👨🏻‍🎨🎨
